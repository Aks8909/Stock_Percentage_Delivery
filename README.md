# Stock_Percentage_Delivery
Hi! in this ML project I have made a stock percentage delivery predictor using regression concepts<br/>

<p>Stock percentage delivery is a financial term that indicates the proportion of shares traded in a particular
stock that is actually delivered and settled through physical transfer of shares rather than being settled 
through intraday trading or speculative trading. In other words, it measures the percentage of shares that 
change ownership and are moved from the seller's demat account to the buyer's demat account as a result of 
a trade.</p>
<br/>
The delivery percentage is an important metric for investors and traders because it can provide insights 
into the level of investor confidence and the overall health of a stock or the market.<br/>
